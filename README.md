I am a 18 years old junior student on Tec de Monterrey Puebla, studying Robotics Engineer (IRS), dreaming of changing the world through technology. I'm really passionate about FRC and I love working and helping my team, Imperator 5887, on programming and electrical issues. I'm always gonna keep learning everything about tech and I hope I can make this dream come true.
